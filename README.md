## 🎮 Gamification Rules  

The original tales had a twist – if King Vikram answered Betal’s questions, Betal would escape. Silence was dangerous.  
I’ve reimagined this logic into gameplay:  

- ✅ **Answer Correctly** – Betal gets angry 😡, goes back to sleep, but you earn a **coin**.  
- ❌ **Answer Wrong** – Betal curses you ⚡ with a **30-second cooldown** where you cannot pick another story.  
- 🤷 **Choose “I Don’t Know”** – Betal accepts your honesty without anger and resets normally, but:  
  - You can only use this **3 times per session**.  
  - It also triggers a **30-second cooldown**.  

This creates a balance of **wit, risk, and strategy**—just like the original Vikram & Betal dynamic!

## 🌱 Why This Project?  

I created **Betal’s Tales** to make **Indian folklore engaging for Gen-Z** through AI, storytelling, and gamification.  
It’s not just about reading stories—it’s about **experiencing them**, reflecting on **morals**, and interacting with a mischievous Betal who tests your wisdom.

## ⚡ Final Word  

**Awaken Betal. Hear the tales. Face the questions.**  
But beware—the wrong answer may cost you more than just time...

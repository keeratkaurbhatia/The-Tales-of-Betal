    "content": "A wealthy man once tricked a poor farmer into giving up his well, but refused him the water, saying he had only sold the well. The farmer went to Birbal, the wise minister in Emperor Akbar's court. Birbal smiled and told the wealthy man, 'If you sold the well, then you cannot keep your water in it. Either let the farmer use it or pay rent for keeping your water there.' The court laughed, and the farmer got justice. True wisdom lies in turning words of deceit into words of truth.",

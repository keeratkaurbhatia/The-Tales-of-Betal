    theme: 'wisdom',
    content: `Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived an old man with three sons. The old man was known throughout the village for his wisdom and kindness. As he grew older, he wanted to test which of his sons would inherit his wisdom. He gave each son a single grain of rice and told them to make it multiply by the next full moon. The first son planted it and got a small harvest. The second son sold it and bought more rice. But the third son gave it to a hungry child, saying that kindness multiplies in ways grain cannot.`,

    content: `In a court case, a poor man was accused of stealing from a rich merchant. Many witnesses came forward, but their stories contradicted each other. Finally, a simple washerman stepped forward. "I saw everything," he said quietly. "The merchant dropped his purse, and this man picked it up and ran after him to return it. But the merchant was in his carriage and didn't hear him calling." The rich merchant, embarrassed by his false accusation, not only apologized but rewarded the honest man for his integrity.`,

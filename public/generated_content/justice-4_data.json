The eldest wanted the fertile fields, the middle brother wanted the forest, and the youngest wanted the riverside. They argued for months until a wise woman suggested a solution Each of you will divide the land into three parts as you see fit. Then, the other two will choose their portions first. Suddenly, each brother began to divide more fairly, knowing they might not get their first choice. All three ended up satisfied with the fair division.",

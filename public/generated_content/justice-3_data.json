Ravi immediately blamed Suresh and demanded punishment for him. Suresh remained quiet but showed the elder his hands they were clean, while Ravi's were stained with mango juice. Moreover, Suresh had been helping his sick mother all morning, as several neighbors confirmed. The elder realized that the loudest accuser was often the guilty one trying to deflect blame.",

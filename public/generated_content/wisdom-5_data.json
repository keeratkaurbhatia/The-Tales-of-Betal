Why did you bite me after I saved you asked the dying farmer. It is my nature replied the snake. You knew what I was when you picked me up. A wise old woman who witnessed this said, Kindness is a virtue, but wisdom knows when and where to apply it. Not all who suffer deserve our help if they will use it to harm others.",
